# 35.-Star-Wars-Reinforcement-Learning

its less on the RL algorithms, but more on learning how to design a good RL Environment (such as the reward functions, etc.)


FOr phase 3, NPC ships are regenerated cuz by the time the explorers decide to send a new drone, the state of the war could be different and new ships will occupy the area so yea.


talk about the future phase 4 and 5, and possibly using LLMs. Might do it when free 

Call if anyone wanna contribute (e.g. a new environment/better reward function for the existing ones, feel free to do a pull request)

Put extra render of the seperatist and republic logo, maybe planet logo also in the simulation
