# 35.-Star-Wars-Reinforcement-Learning

its less on the RL algorithms, but more on learning how to design a good RL Environment (such as the reward functions, etc.)


FOr phase 3, NPC ships are regenerated cuz by the time the explorers decide to send a new drone, the state of the war could be different and new ships will occupy the area so yea.
